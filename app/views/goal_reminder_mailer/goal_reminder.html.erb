    <h1>Hi <%= @user.given_name %></h1>
    <p>
      Just a friendly reminder â€” the by-when you set for a goal of yours is a week away. Yay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Goal: <%= @goal.content %>
    </p>
    <p>

      If you need help to complete this goal, touch base with your squad. They're your biggest cheerleaders. :)

      You got this!
